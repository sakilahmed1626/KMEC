# KMEC
KMEC (Extended K-means for Equal Clustering) is an algorithm for generating equal clusters. It extends the current K-means algorithm.
The kmean.py script generates random data points based on user's requirement and then clusters the data points
using K-means algorithm first and then clusters again using KMEC. The number of clusters, total data points, points per cluster has to be set by the user at the beginning of clustering. 

# HOW TO RUN
Copy the KMEC.py and Cluster.py and create a new folder in the workspace directory. Paste the files keep it in the same folder. Import the codes using the editor (eg. Eclipse) and the run the code.
